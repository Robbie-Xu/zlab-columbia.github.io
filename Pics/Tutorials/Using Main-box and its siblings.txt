
"Main-box" (and its sibling "Contact-box") are used on almost every page to create new topics. There are only used
when encapsulated by the "wrapper" div tags. Here is an example from molecules.html of how "Main-box" is used:
------------------------------------
<body>
   <div id="container">
      <div id="wrapper">
         <!--Beginning of main-box-->
         <div class="main-box">
            <div class="heading">
               Optical Lattice
            </div>
            <img src="Pics/Lattice.jpg" width="350px" alt="Optical lattice" />
            <p>
               When the atoms are cooled to near the absolute zero, they get trapped in an interference pattern of light.
               This trap is called an optical lattice due to its perfectly repetitive pattern.  When the trap light is shined along one
               direction, the lattice sites are flat as pancakes.  Along the short dimension of the pancakes, the atoms
               experience minimal motion.  We choose this direction for probing them, to maximize the degree of precision
               and control.
            </p>
         </div>
         <!--End of main-box-->
      </div>
   </div>
</body>
------------------------------------
Main-box begins with the heading:

<div class="heading">
   Optical Lattice
</div>

This is the section with the blue background at the top of the box. Following the heading are paragraphs and images.
In the new version of the website, <p> will automatically space and format itself when used inside a main-box
class <div> tag, meaning no extra <br />s are necessary. <img> will also automatically center itself and generate the
blue border around the image.

<img src="Pics/Lattice.jpg" width="350px" alt="Optical lattice" />

To create a new main-box, copying an old one and switching out the content is the easiest method. Here is a template:
------------------------------------
<div class="main-box">
	<div class="heading">
		This is the Name of the Topic
	</div>
	<img src="[the image directory goes here]" width="[size]px" alt="[Alternate text in case the image doesn't display]" />
	<p>
		Description of the topic goes here.
	</p>
</div>
