
Prefered scale: 2x by 2y 
(where the image is set to be "x" by "y" on the website)

Important: Please use the prefered scale if possible. These high 
resolution images are needed to combat pixelation issues 
with high DPI displays (i.e. 4K UHD monitor).

Note:
Although the website will autoscale any images, loading 
times are reduced if they are already scaled properly. 
Please scale according to the following guide given in
("width" by "height"). HTML's rescaling code is very crude
and will cause issues when the new resolution is not an 
divisor of the old resolution. For example 720 x 480 rescaled
by HTML to 600 x 360 will cause unnecessary pixelation).
