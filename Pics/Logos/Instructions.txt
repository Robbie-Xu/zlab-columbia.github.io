Important: Please use these larger dimensions instead of
the dimensions to which the website scales them. These high 
resolution images are needed to combat pixelation issues 
with high DPI displays (i.e. 4K UHD monitor).

Note:
Although the website will autoscale any images, loading 
times are reduced if they are already scaled properly. 
Please scale according to the following guide given in
("width" by "height"). PNG is prefered over JPG and other 
formats.
